The code is in Json.Py

Brief summary of this project prompt in your own words
My bot is supposed to produce a random inspirational quote when the user clicks the button. 

Explanation of what you chose and why, and what “being successful” meant to you
I made this bot because I want to be more positive and productive in my life and I think if I can see a quote when I am having negative thoughts it will help me mentally.

Full explanation of what your program does
Right now I have a JSON file(file that holds data) with different quotes and the author of each of the quotes. My bot command is not completely finished so right now my bot cannot pull the quotes from the JSON file to display.

ID any “skeleton” sources that make up the bones of your code
Most of my code comes from Liam's JSON video on his YouTube channel. The quotes I got came from ChatGpt Generating quotes for me to use for my bot.

Full explanation of how your code improves upon any skeleton code
Liam's video helped me understand what I needed to open to file in order to receive the quotes from my JSON file.
